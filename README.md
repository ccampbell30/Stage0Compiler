# Stage0Compiler
This is the first iteration of my teams remake of a Pascalite compiler

We used our knowledge of c++ as well as a set of grammer rules given to us to constuct this compiler.
This compiler takes in a .dat file of input. It then compiles it into a listing file(.lst) and an assembly file(.asm).

I have included one sample .dat file that we were given to compile. This is the link to view the rest of the .dat files we based
our tests on.

I am not sure if my file is the most updated. My teammate made some last minute changes right before we turned it in but it was nothing critical. but This demonstrates my knowledge of various c++ aspects as well as a deep understanding of problem solving. We got a 96 on this assignment.
