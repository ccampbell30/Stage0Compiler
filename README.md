# Stage0Compiler
This is the first iteration of my teams remake of a Pascalite compiler

We used our knowledge of c++ as well as a set of grammer rules given to us to constuct this compiler.
This compiler takes in a .dat file of input. It then compiles it into a listing file(.lst) and an assembly file(.asm).

I have included one sample .dat file that we were given to compile. This is the link to view the rest of the .dat files we based
our tests on.
